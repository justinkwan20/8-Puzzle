# 8-Puzzle
8 Puzzle is a project that I worked on at University Of Massachusetts Boston. It is a simulation of a 8 Puzzle slider and also it has the
ability to solve the solution. This game allows you to slide tiles either left right top or bottom based on the open space. There is also
a solver for this puzzle game to automatically solve the puzzle for us. There is a visual representation of the 8 puzzle silder.
